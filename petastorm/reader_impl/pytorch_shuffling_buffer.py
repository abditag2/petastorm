        Items may be retrieved from the buffer once ``min_after_retrieve`` items were added to the queue
        (indicated by ``can_retrieve``).

        Items may be added to the buffer as long as the number of items in the buffer (not including the items
        passed to :func:`add_many`) does not exceed ``shuffling_queue_capacity``.

        The amount of items in the buffer may actually become more than ``shuffling_buffer_capacity`` since
        :func:`add_many` is passed a list of items. The *hard limit* on the number of items in the buffer is
        ``shuffling_buffer_capacity + extra_capacity``.

        Explanation:
        This batch loader performs some non-conventional operations:

        Let's say we enqueued several samples:

        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

        Now during a retrieve() we sample the order these samples will be retrieved:

        [2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 0, 6]

        Once an order has been sampled, we slice the order into batches of ``batch_size`` samples.
        And index 1 batch at a time:

        [1, 2, X, 4, X, 6, 7] -> [3, 5] (batch 1)
        [1, X, X, 4, X, X, 7] -> [6 ,2] (batch 2)

        We could compress the buffer after every retrieve(), but that would require custom ops.

        When we call add_many we first rearrange the remaining elements:

        [1, 4, 7]

        Then append new elements:
        [1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]

        After add_many we have to resample a permutation for the buffer.

        :param shuffling_buffer_capacity: Items may be added to the buffer as long as the amount of items in the
          buffer does not exceed the value of ``shuffling_queue_capacity`` (not including the items
          passed to :func:`add_many`).
        :param min_after_retrieve: Minimal amount of items in the buffer that allows retrieval. This is needed to
          guarantee good random shuffling of elements. Once :func:`finish` is called, items can be retrieved even if
          the condition does not hold.
        :param extra_capacity: The amount of items in the buffer may grow above ``shuffling_buffer_capacity``
          (due to a call to :func:`add_many` with a list of items), but must remain under ``extra_capacity``. Should be
          set to the upper bound of the number of items that can be added in a single call to :func:`add_many` (can be a
          loose bound).
        :param batch_size: The number of items to be retrieved for each self.retrieve() call.
        This also affects the can_add and can can_retrieve accordingly.
